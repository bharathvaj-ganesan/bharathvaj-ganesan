### Hey ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Bharath.

I'm a software engineer and engineering leader with 6+ years of experience building and scaling products across startups and enterprise.

Currently leading AI initiatives at [Chargebee](https://www.chargebee.com/), Iâ€™ve worked on AI Agents, Copilot, and internal productivity tools. Iâ€™m big on engineering craftsmanship, improving developer experience, and sharing what I learn with the community here.
