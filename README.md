### Hey ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Bharath.

I'm a **software engineer** with 6+ years of experience, passionate about building purposeful products with strong technical depth. I graduated in **Computer Science Engineering** and have always been driven by a deep curiosity about how software systems work â€” a mindset that continues to drive me today.

Currently leading AI initiatives at [Chargebee](https://www.chargebee.com/) building AI Agents, Copilot, and internal productivity tools. Iâ€™m big on engineering craftsmanship, improving developer experience, and sharing what I learn with the community here.
